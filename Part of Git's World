Part of Git’s World

Look at this tool
Isn’t it neat?
Didn’t you think your project was complete?
Didn’t you think you had it all,
that you had everything? 

Look at this trove
Commands untold
How many wonders can one DVCS hold?
Lookin’ around here you’d think,
“Nope
I don’t have everything…”

You’ve got Subversion and Perforce aplenty
CVS and Google Docs galore
Want email chains?
You’ve got twenty
But who cares?
They’ve got faults
You want more

You want to be where the
Git changes are
You want to see, want to see ‘em happen
Waitin’ around in that—what do you call it?
Oh, repo.
Usin’ somethin’ else you don’t get too far
Git is required for smiles, laughin’ 
Fetchin’ and mergin’ to that—(forgot that word again)—
Repo!

Up-to-date git log!
Up-to-date Git fun!
Up-to-date Git lets you work on the run!
Travelin’ free
You could soon be
Part of Git’s world

What you could save
If you could change all of those mistakes
What you could give
If you could live
Worry free
Bet ya with me
(I’m Git, you see)
Bet ya you’d chase away those headaches
No more losin’
Just Git usin’
Then you could be…

Ready to make your own master branch
Working in groups
Just got faster
Using Terminal and—what’s the word—git init?

When will you commit?
Wouldn’t you love?
Love to explore Git’s core foolproof hub?
